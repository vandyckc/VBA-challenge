# VBA-challenge

I worked on this code myself by following recorded lectures, as well as finding examples online to gain a better of understanding of what was needed. I had some help from askBCS, YouTube, and StackOverflow. However, the bulk of the code was written with my peers in a study group. I collaborated with Mike Monary, Alex Nguyen, and Adam Chang.
